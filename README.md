# Complexity Analysis
The process of analysing how efficient an algorithm is. Complexity analysis usually involves finding both the **Time Complexity** and the **Space Complexity** of an algorithm.
Complexity analysis is used to effectively determined how "good" an algorithm is and whether it's "better" than another one.

### Time Complexity
A measure of how fast an algorithm runs, time complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and coding interviews.
It's expressed using **Big O** notation

### Space Complexity
A measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up, space complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and coding interviews.
It's expressed using **Big O** notation
